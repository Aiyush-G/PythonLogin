# Aiyush Gupta Python Login

This is my project for the python login project. I have taken more time to do this project and have created both a web application and a desktop MacOS native application.

## Brief

Points
4 - Works and easy to use for the user. Comments included on your program

3 - Works but not clear to the user. Limited to no comments on your program

2 - Code is correct but either file not read or written to correctly. No comments

1 - Code is incorrect / incomplete.

0 - No work handed in.

## How to use

### Native Application

I have stored the native application within the folder py2app, under the dist directory. NOTE: this has only been tested on my computer.

```bash
Right click on "Aiyush Gupta Python Login" --> open
"Are you sure you want to open application from unidentified developer" 
--> Yes --> The application should run
```
### Web Application
Both versions of the application work in the exact same fashion, the purpose of the native desktop application was to try and learn how to convert a web application into a native application.

## Features and how to use?
This application allows a user to login to their existing account, an example of this would be:
```
Login: Aiyush Gupta
Email: <my school email> (not included as this is public)
Password: ABCD
```
Create an account:
By default the application open  up on the create an account page, here you can fill in your details and then you will be redirected to the login page. You can then login there. Throughout the whole application I have done heavy error handling so there isn't a way to break it.... yet....


After a successful login you will be directed to a school's website. As of yet, there is no way to remove credentials from the text file, so please bear that in mind.
